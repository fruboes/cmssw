1. Follow git-cheatsheet to get the code. Build it


2. Create a file containing definition of data directories (for PAT tuples and trees):

-----------------
PATbasePATH="/scratch/scratch0/tfruboes/DJNewFW/PATFiles/"
TTreeBasePATH="/scratch/scratch0/tfruboes/DJNewFW/TreeFiles/"
-----------------

in yours you should give correct paths. Tell the framework where this file is 
by setting shell env variable:

export SmallXAnaDefFile=~/MyAnalisys.py


3. Another shell environment variable (SmallXAnaVersion) contains path to a
file with samples definition. You can set this variable by sourcing selected
file from 

MNTriggerStudies/MNTriggerAna/env/

directory
